Sure! You can try Mildreds or Ethos for vegetarian options. I usually look at reviews and menus when picking a place to eat. A fun fact about London: The Big Ben clock tower is technically known as the Elizabeth Tower. The weather today in London is partly cloudy. If it's sunny, you could enjoy a stroll in Hyde Park or visit the Buckingham Palace gardens.
