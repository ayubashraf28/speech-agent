Of course! I recommend checking out Mildreds for vegetarian options in Oxford Street. I usually look for online reviews when picking a place to eat. A fun fact about London is that it has more Indian restaurants than Mumbai. Today's weather in London is partly cloudy. If it's sunny, you could explore Hyde Park or visit the Sky Garden for a great view!
