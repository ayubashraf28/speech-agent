Hi there. Can you help me figure out a good place to grab lunch around here in Oxford Street London? Oh, and maybe also tell us if there are any vegetarian options? By the way, how do you usually pick a place to eat? And while you're at it, can you share a quick fun fact about this city? One last thing, what's the weather looking like today? Yeah, and maybe suggest something fun we could do if it's sunny.
